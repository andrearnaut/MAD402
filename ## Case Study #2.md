## Introduction
A financial application may be used to view their bank accounts, send funds, or even look at the exchange rate of various currency values. Whether you are using it for online banking, viewing the market for cryptocurrency, or even to see if your significant other has very horrible spending habits, a fincancial application will have a link to a bank account.

## Analysis
One of the biggest flaws of financial applications is data security. Data security is often caused by hackers using a Trojan known as "Faketoken", overlaying with a fake URL directing to their bank and can even perform a sim swap, messing with the two factor authentication. The reason why I think financial applications should have stronger security is because of the hackers ability to always find some kind of exploit through the code, and utilizing bug bounties would be a great step in the right direction towards stronger security.
A repeating pattern found in financial applications is that the application will have a similar layout, with a very minimal design usually using primary colors.

## Use Case/Target Audience
-Targets anyone who has a bank account/has a knowledge of cryptocurrency
-Users need an account to access the application

## Conclusion
In conclusion, with my case study of financial apps and the ever-evolving landscape of financial applications, the significance of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) cannot be overstated. The case study delved into the intricate relationship between design and functionality, aiming to enhance the financial journey for users. Financial applications should have stronger security features, with bug bounty being frequently utilized prior to pushing a new update onto the servers. The case study underscores the paramount importance of a user-centric approach in the development of financial applications. By prioritizing intuitive design, seamless interactions, and a positive emotional connection, we pave the way for a future where financial management is not just a task but a gratifying and empowering experience for users.
